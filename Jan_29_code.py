#Code samples from January 29
# This is a comment
print("hello, world")

# Some example variable assignments
num_candy = 4  # Integer variable; initialized to 4
price_candy = 0.58  # Float variable; initialized to 0.58
message = "Your total cost is" # string variable; initialized to this literal

#now, multiply the number of pieces of candy by the
#price of each piece of candy to get the total cost
total_cost = num_candy * price_candy

# total_cost is a float variable - an int times a float is a float

# Now print out the total cost with a helpful message
print(message, total_cost)
